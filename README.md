Equipment Requirements

The following are the recommendations of the CSG for fencing equipment. Anyone who refuses
to wear the proper personal protective equipment will not be permitted to participate. Anyone
who intentionally obscures, or prevents from being known, errors, damages and defects in
personal protective equipment may be subject to disciplinary action.

Notes:

• All references to the word “metal” mean steel unless specifically noted otherwise.

• NO fencing in shorts or short sleeves will be permitted.

“Hockey gloves” refers to the La Crosse / street hockey type, not ice hockey gloves, which deter
mobility without providing sufficiently increased protection.

Dagger Training/Fencing

Armour:
1. Fencing mask
2. Leather gloves (free-fencing only)
3. Gorget (free-fencing only)
4. Athletic cup suggested for men (free-fencing only)
5. When using daggers against heavier weapon systems, the armour rules of the heavier
weapon apply.

Weapons:
Steel flexi-daggers with a rubber blunt, or a nylon trainer. Additional control should be used
when thrusting with the dagger.


Rapier Fencing Equipment

Armour:
1. Helmet (12-kilogram three-weapon/sabre fencing mask or better) with back of head
protection.
2. Gorget
3. Leather gauntlets with a high cuff
4. A canvas jacket is acceptable but heavier protection is recommended. For women, additional
padding for the chest, a modern fencing chest guard or equivalent is strongly encouraged.
5. Athletic cup for men. Additional protection for women is strongly suggested.
6. Rubber arrow “bird blunt” attached and secured to the tip of rapier, with a washer or blunt
inside to prevent breakthrough
* If a fencing mask is in use, no cuts are allowed to the back of the head.

Weapons:
1. Rapiers should be fitted with a flexible, rebated blade with either a blunt or nail tip.
2. Daggers should be fitted with a flexible blade.

Nylon Wasters and Singlestick Fencing Equipment

Armour:
In addition to the Rapier fencing* requirements:
1. Armoured gauntlets, padded mail gloves, lacrosse or street-hockey gloves. The hand and
wrist must be covered. Singlestick baskets must cover the hand and wrist, or a combination
of gear must achieve that protection.
2. Heavy kneepads and additional padding over the elbow.
3. Gorgets should protect the collarbones, or additional padding should be built into the fencing
jacket/doublet/gambeson.
4. Heavy padding on the sword forearm is strongly recommended.
* Head protection must cover the back of the head.

Weapons:
1. Singlesticks will be a 3/4" – 1” rattan dowel fitted to a leather basket.
2. Nylon swords are to be commercially purchased from Purpleheart Armouries.


Steel Longsword and Arming Sword Fencing Equipment

Armour:
1. Minimum 16 g, padded steel helm or a reinforced HEMA fencing mask that provides
protection to the back of the head. The latter is to be worn over a well-padded arming cap if
the mask does not have internal padding.
2. Gorget (hardened leather, brigandine or metal) that provides protection for the collarbones.
3. Steel gauntlets that cover both hands and wrists.
4. Well-padded gambeson or fencing doublet
5. Athletic cup for men
6. Fencing chest guard or equivalent required for women (heavily-padded gambeson equals
“equivalent”).
7. Steel or hardened leather elbow protection is required.
8. Kneepads are required, but steel or hardened leather knee protection is suggested.
9. Leather forearm protection is strongly recommended.
