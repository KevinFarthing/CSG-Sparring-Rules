Equipment Requirements

The following are the requirements of the CSG for fencing equipment. Anyone who refuses to wear the proper personal protective equipment will not be permitted to participate. Anyone who intentionally obscures, or prevents from being known, errors, damages and defects in personal protective equipment may be subject to disciplinary action.

Notes:

• NO fencing in shorts or short sleeves will be permitted.

• When engaging in mixed weapon bouts, the armour rules of the heaviest weapon in the ring apply. When carrying a side arm, the weapon requirements from its section apply.

• Gorgets should protect the collarbones, or additional padding should be built into the fencing jacket/doublet/gambeson.

• A Gambeson is a protective garment intended for HEMA use.
